- 👋 Hi, I’m @BeastOnTheMats! I am a U.S. Air Force veteran.

- 👀 I’m interested in jiu-jitsu and have been training on and off for 8 years. I currently am a blue belt and have been consistent about training for the last 3 years. 
  I also am interested in stock trading and activey trade. I also like to draw and design, I usually am drawing something on paper or creating something on my computer.
  I also make pixel art in my sparetime on Minecraft and upload the builds to Youtube. I am also looking at starting a clothing brand.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS on FreeCodeCamp. I plan on getting all 10 certifications on FreeCodeCamp, and then enrolling in CodePlatoon's online self study course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I can help with. I haven't coded or programmed since high school, but I remember a fair amount of things. 
  Hopefully soon I can contribute and help others.
